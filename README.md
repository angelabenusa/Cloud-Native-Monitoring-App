#### Project Overview

In this project, I developed a cloud-native monitoring application using Python and Flask. The key steps involved are:

1. **Building the Application**:
   - Developed the monitoring application using Python and Flask.

2. **Containerization with Docker**:
   - Created a Dockerfile for the application.
   - Built the Docker image and ran the container locally.

3. **Storing Docker Images**:
   - Used the Boto3 module in Python to create an Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
   - Stored and retrieved Docker images securely and efficiently.

4. **Deploying on Kubernetes**:
   - Created an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with nodes.
   - Deployed the application on Kubernetes.
   - Used Python to create deployment and service configurations for accessing the application over the internet.

This project showcases my ability to build, containerize, and deploy cloud-native applications using modern tools and services like Docker, AWS ECR, and Kubernetes.# Cloud-Native-Monitoring-App
